                Oh right, oh
                oh why na-da-da-da

                I keep my head high
                I got my wings to carry me
                I don't know freedom
                I want my dreams to rescue me
                I keep my faith strong
                I ask the Lord to follow me

                I've been unfaithful
                I don't know why you call on me

                This is my canvas

                I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
                This is my canvas
                I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
